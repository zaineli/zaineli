# ZAIN ALI.
#### AI ENGINEER / AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS ARCHITECT

I engineer agency. My work focuses on bridging the gap between experimental LLM capabilities and reliable production systems, moving beyond simple retrieval into multi-step reasoning and autonomous execution.

## ARCHITECTURE & TOOLING

**ORCHESTRATION**
LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGPT, Semantic Kernel.
*Focus on state management and directed cyclic graphs for agent behavior.*

**INFERENCE & MODELING**
PyTorch, OpenAI API, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama (Local deployment).
*Experience fine-tuning small models for specific reasoning tasks.*

**INFRASTRUCTURE**
Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, Vector Stores (Pinecone/Weaviate).
*Building scalable environments for concurrent agent operations.*

## SELECTED WORKS

### 01 // VisionTactical Agent
**Status:** Active / Research
> **The Concept:** An autonomous agent that plays 3D FPS games using visual perception only. It does not hook into game code; it "sees" pixels and makes tactical decisions.
>
> **The Engineering:** Utilizes a multimodal pipeline. Mistral Vision handles frame interpretation while DeepSeek V3 processes spatial strategy. Input is injected via Ursina Engine based on calculated trajectories.

### 02 // SynapseGraph
**Status:** Production
> **The Concept:** A distributed research system replacing standard RAG. Instead of retrieving documents, it spawns agents to actively browse, critique, and synthesize live web data.
>
> **The Engineering:** Built on a WebSocket architecture for real-time streaming. Uses a LangGraph supervisor to manage specialized sub-agents (Scraper, Analyst, Writer) to ensure factual consistency and reduce hallucinations.

## COLLABORATION

I am currently open to consulting and engineering roles focused on **Agentic Workflows** and **Complex RAG Systems**.

If you are building systems where the AI needs to act as a decision-maker rather than just a chatbot, we should connect.
